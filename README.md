# Artificial_Neural_Network_Car_Sale_Prediction
Developed ANN model for car sales prediction. Trained on historical data including car features, pricing, and sales records. Utilized multiple hidden layers for complex pattern recognition. Achieved high accuracy in forecasting future car sales trends. Deployed for informed business decisions. This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for predicting car sale amounts using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The notebook includes data preprocessing, visualization, model training, and prediction using the `Car_Purchasing_Data.csv` dataset.

## Notebook

### Artificial Neural Network Car Sale Prediction.ipynb

This notebook covers:
- Importing necessary libraries
- Loading and exploring the dataset (`Car_Purchasing_Data.csv`)
- Visualizing the dataset using pair plots
- Preparing the data by dropping unnecessary columns (`Customer Name`, `Customer e-mail`, `Country`, `Car Purchase Amount`)
- Normalizing the input features using `MinMaxScaler`
- Splitting the dataset into training and test sets
- Building an ANN model using TensorFlow/Keras with:
  - Input layer of 5 neurons
  - Two hidden layers with 40 neurons each and ReLU activation
  - Output layer with 1 neuron and linear activation
- Compiling the model with `adam` optimizer and `mean_squared_error` loss function
- Training the model with 100 epochs and batch size of 50
- Visualizing the training loss progression
- Making predictions using the trained model for a sample input

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/car-sale-prediction.git
    ```

2. **Open the notebook:**
    - You can open the notebook using Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.

## Usage

This notebook serves as a template for predicting car sale amounts using an Artificial Neural Network. Modify and customize the notebook as per your specific dataset and requirements.

## Acknowledgments

- The initial template was automatically generated by Google Colab.
- The dataset used (`Car_Purchasing_Data.csv`) is assumed to be provided separately.

Feel free to explore and expand upon this notebook for your own projects. Happy coding!
